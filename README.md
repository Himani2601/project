To log in to GitHub using Git Bash, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Git Bash on your computer.

2. Run the following command to set your Git username:
   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
   ```
   Replace "Your GitHub Username" with your actual GitHub username.

3. Run the following command to set your Git email address:
   ```
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Replace "your_email@example.com" with the email associated with your GitHub account.

4. Now, you can log in to GitHub using HTTPS by running Git commands that interact with GitHub (e.g., `git clone`, `git pull`, `git push`). When prompted, enter your GitHub username and password.

Alternatively, if you prefer to use SSH keys for authentication, you can generate an SSH key pair and add the public key to your GitHub account. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Git Bash on your computer.

2. Run the following command to generate a new SSH key:
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Replace "your_email@example.com" with the email associated with your GitHub account.

3. When prompted, press Enter to accept the default file location for the key.

4. Optionally, you can enter a passphrase for added security, or press Enter to skip this step.

5. After the key pair is generated, run the following command to start the SSH agent:
   ```
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

6. Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent by running the following command:
   ```
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

7. Now, you need to add the SSH public key to your GitHub account. You can do this by copying the SSH public key to your clipboard:
   ```
   clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   If the `clip` command doesn't work on your system, you can manually open the `id_rsa.pub` file located in the `~/.ssh/` directory and copy its contents.

8. Visit the GitHub website, go to "Settings" > "SSH and GPG keys" > "New SSH key", and paste the copied public key into the provided field.

9. Finally, test your SSH connection to GitHub by running the following command in Git Bash:
   ```
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   You may see a confirmation message indicating that you've successfully authenticated with GitHub.

Now, you should be able to use Git commands with GitHub without needing to enter your username and password each time.
